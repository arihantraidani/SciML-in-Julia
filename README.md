# julia-odes-and-pdes
This repository contains simulations and models of ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs &amp; PDEs) using the Julia programming language. These projects were developed as part of my learning journey in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML), using the `DifferentialEquations.jl` ecosystem.
