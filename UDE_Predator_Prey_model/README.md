We study Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) on the Lotka–Volterra predator-prey system by replacing the interaction terms with neural networks trained from synthetic trajectories. Using Lux (with Zygote adjoints) we fit two small feedforward networks to emulate the unknown interaction functions. Results show that the UDE partially reproduces state trajectories—notably for predators—but struggles to match the sharp, early interaction transients for prey. We discuss causes (scale imbalance, identifiability, and transient stiffness), show diagnostics, and outline practical remedies.
